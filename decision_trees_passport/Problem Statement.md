## Description

The ministry observed that there a lot of people who entered the country with a fake passport. Now, they
want to verifyat a large scale to get a rough estimate on who all could be having a fake passport. So, they
planned to use the uploaded images of the passport to try and identify the fake ones. Imagine you're an ML
consultant to the defence ministry of India. You're given a labelled dataset to identify the potentially 
fake passports from the original ones. The dataset contains a few properties of the images like correlation
of photo with person's photo, contrast, energy and inverse difference moment.

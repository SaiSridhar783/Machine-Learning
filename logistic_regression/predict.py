"""
Predicts the target values for data in the file at 'test_X_file_path', using the weights learned during training.
Writes the predicted values to the file named "predicted_test_Y_lg.csv". It should be created in the same directory where this code file is present.
This code is provided to help you get started and is NOT a complete implementation. Modify it based on the requirements of the project.

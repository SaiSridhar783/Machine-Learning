## Description

Harry and Hermione are in the 2nd year of Hogwarts. While wandering around Hogwarts, they came
across a room filled with new potions that are being created. Both Harry and Hermione want to
find out the category that each of the potions belong to, so that they can use them for the
appropriate scenarios.

Assume that there are only 4 categories of potions that are being prepared in the room. The 
cocmpositions for each of the potion vary over a range of values. A book with the data of 
various potions, their cocmpositions and the corresponding categories is available in the
school library.

Categories are: 
- Anti-Aging
- Transmigration
- Healing	
- Memory

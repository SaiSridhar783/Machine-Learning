## Description

Consider the case of Pune Labs in India. As the number of cases of COVID-19 is increasing
day by day, the government decides to predict the number of cases that would be critical,
so that they can provide more ventilators.

As an AI/ML expert , your task is to predict wheter a person would get critical or not. You
are provided with the data of the cases like age, sex, travelled place, immunity level, fever
frequency, breathing difficulty level and blood sugar.

**Note:** Travelled place is a nominal feature with values '0', '1', '2'

Preprocess the data and apply logistic regression with regularization for this classification
problem to achieve a good F1 score (weighted >0.75).

# Machine Learning

### This project contains the implementation of several **Supervised Machine Learning Models** most of them being implemented from scratch.
These Models include the following :
- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] k-NN Classification *(no K-D trees, LSH, Inverted Lists)*
- [x] Logistic Regression *(One-vs-All approach)*
- [x] Decision Trees
- [x] Support Vector Machines *(SVM)*
- [x] Decision Trees *(for input data in ARFF Format)*
- [x] Naive Bayes Classifier
- [] Random Forest Classifier
- [x] Locally Weighted Regression *(with alternative of regression trees)*
- [x] Preprocessing the Data and applying Regularization
- [] Boosting

# Machine Learning

### This project contains the implementation of several **Supervised Machine Learning Models** most of them being implemented from scratch.
These Models include the following :
- Linear Regression
- k-NN Classification *(no K-D trees, LSH, Inverted Lists)*
- Logistic Regression *(One-vs-All approach)*
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines *(SVM)*
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Locally Weighted Regression *(with alternative of regression trees)*
